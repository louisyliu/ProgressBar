ProgressBar is a small collection of MATLAB utility functions designed to enhance the user experience by providing visually appealing and informative progress tracking for loops and displaying formatted titles. 

The project includes two main functions:

`disptitle`: Displays a title string centered within a line of dashes, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing format for displaying titles.
